# Click_on_ad_prediction

In this project we have workied with a fake advertising data set downloaded from kaggle, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.
We created a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:

*'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes<br /> 
*'Age': cutomer age in years<br /> 
*'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer<br /> 
*'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet<br /> 
*'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement<br /> 
*'City': City of consumer<br /> 
*'Male': Whether or not consumer was male<br /> 
*'Country': Country of consumer<br /> 
*'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window<br />
